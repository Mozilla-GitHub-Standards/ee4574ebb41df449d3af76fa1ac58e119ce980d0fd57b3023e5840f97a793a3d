# Setting up Terraform

You'll be setting it up locally. Install it like it says from the website. Clone this repo, then create a file called "terraform.tfvars" in the root of this repo. Add your AWS client ID and secret key like so:

    access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
    secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
